## AP Project

Project Description
----
This is a replica of the game **Tank Stars** designed in Java using LibGDX. It features a single-player and a multiplayer game mode, has support for saving and resuming games and has a simple and intuitive user interface that allows the user to learn on the way as they use it.  

It also features close-to-real-life physics that tries to accurately simulate the movement of tanks and trajectory of projectiles through space.  

Repository Description

### Project Folder
The [Project](https://github.com/latentghost/AP_Project/tree/main/Project) folder contains all the relevant code files. To start the game, run [Main.java](https://github.com/latentghost/AP_Project/blob/main/Project/core/src/com/tankstars/Main.java).

### Assets Folder
The [Project/assets/](https://github.com/latentghost/AP_Project/tree/main/Project/assets) folder contains all the images and vectors used to build the visuals of the game.

### Non-Project Folder
The [Non-Project](https://github.com/latentghost/AP_Project/tree/main/Non_Project) folder showcases the UML diagrams that demonstrate the workflow of the game. It provides insights into the architecture and design of the game.

🎥 Additionally, you can find a [gameplay recording](https://github.com/latentghost/AP_Project/blob/main/Non_Project/game_recording.mov.zip) in this folder. This recording walks you through how to play the game after running [Main.java](https://github.com/latentghost/AP_Project/blob/main/Project/core/src/com/tankstars/Main.java). It's a great resource to understand the gameplay mechanics and strategies.
